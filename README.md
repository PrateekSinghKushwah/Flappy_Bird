1. Importing libraries:
   - The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including `pygame` for game development and `random` for generating random numbers.

2. Initializing Pygame:
   - The `pygame.init()` function is called to initialize the Pygame library.

3. Setting up the game window:
   - The `window_width` and `window_height` variables define the dimensions of the game window.
   - The `window` variable is created using `pygame.display.set_mode()` to set up the game window with the specified dimensions.
   - The `pygame.display.set_caption()` function sets the caption for the game window.

4. Defining colors:
   - Color variables are defined using RGB values to represent different elements in the game, such as the background, bird, and pipes.

5. Bird properties:
   - The bird's properties, such as the radius, initial position (`bird_x` and `bird_y`), velocity, and acceleration, are defined.

6. Pipe properties:
   - The pipe's properties, including width, gap, and velocity, are defined.

7. Score, font, and clock:
   - Variables for the score, font size, and clock are defined.

8. Game functions:
   - `create_pipe()` function generates a new pipe with random height and returns its properties.
   - `move_pipes()` function updates the positions of the pipes by decrementing their x-coordinates.
   - `draw_bird()` function draws the bird on the game window using a circle shape.
   - `draw_pipes()` function draws the pipes on the game window using rectangles.
   - `check_collision()` function checks for collisions between the bird and the pipes or the window boundaries.
   - `update_score()` function renders and displays the current score on the game window.

9. Main game loop:
   - The main game loop starts with a `while` loop that runs as long as the `running` variable is `True`.
   - The loop processes user events, such as quitting the game or pressing the spacebar to make the bird jump.
   - The game window is filled with the background color.
   - New pipes are created and moved, and the bird's position is updated based on velocity and acceleration.
   - The bird, pipes, score, and game elements are drawn on the game window.
   - The collision between the bird and the pipes or window boundaries is checked.
   - The score is updated and displayed on the game window.
   - The display is updated, and the frame rate is set to 60 frames per second.

10. Quitting the game:
    - When the game loop ends (the `running` variable becomes `False`), the Pygame library is quit using `pygame.quit()`.
